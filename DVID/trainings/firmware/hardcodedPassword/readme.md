# Hardcoded password training
## Goal
A confidential message is stored on the firmware but protected by a password.

## Guidelines
* Extract the firmware
* Locate the password
* Write the password over the UART connection
* Get the flag

NB : Nothing will be printed on the serial (just RX is configured)

## Result
The flag is an animal's name.
